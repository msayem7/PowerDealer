SMALL / LIGHTWEIGHT SOFTWARE GUIDELINE

PURPOSE

This guideline is for MVPs, admin panels, internal tools, and
prototypes. Focus is speed and simplicity.

TECH STACK

Backend: Django + DRF Frontend: Vue 3 + Pinia Auth: Simple JWT or
session Testing: Minimal

BACKEND STRUCTURE

app/ models.py serializers.py views.py urls.py

Keep things flat and simple.

MODELS

-   Keep fields minimal.
-   Avoid premature abstractions.
-   Only add relations when needed.

SERIALIZERS

-   Use ModelSerializer.
-   Keep validation simple.

VIEWS

-   Use APIView.
-   Keep logic readable.
-   No service layer unless required.

ERROR HANDLING

Just return errors and display them simply in UI.

FRONTEND STRUCTURE

src/ api/ stores/ views/ components/

Keep folder layout flat.

API LAYER

Use one axios instance. Do not call axios directly in components.

PINIA STORES

Stores keep: - list data - loading state

Keep logic small and readable.

AUTH

Use simple JWT. Skip refresh logic unless required.

TESTING

Test only critical APIs and main screens.

GOAL

This guideline ensures fast delivery without over-engineering.
